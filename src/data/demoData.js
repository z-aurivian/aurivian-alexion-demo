      discussionContext: 'Oral Factor B inhibitor represents the most significant long-term competitive threat. However, Ultomiris defenders cite the established long-term safety profile, absence of hepatic monitoring, and proven efficacy across all four indications as differentiators.',
      strategicImplication: 'High strategic priority — iptacopan represents a potential paradigm shift toward oral complement inhibition. Ultomiris defense strategy must emphasize multi-indication breadth, long-term safety certainty, and complete C5 inhibition advantages.',
      aiSummaryCurrent: 'Iptacopan competition against Ultomiris is generating more nuanced discussion than against Soliris, with physicians acknowledging that Ultomiris Q8W convenience partially offsets the oral advantage. Key differentiator discussions focus on iptacopan addressing C3-mediated EVH while Ultomiris provides proven C5 inhibition across four indications with 5+ years of safety data.',
      aiSummaryPrior: 'Iptacopan was viewed primarily as a future threat to Ultomiris, with physicians expressing that the current clinical evidence was insufficient to switch stable Ultomiris patients.

      aiSummaryCurrent: 'Pegcetacoplan mentions in Ultomiris interactions are notably lower than in Soliris discussions, reflecting physician perception that sustained C5 inhibition with extended half-life ravulizumab addresses many of the residual hemolysis concerns that drive C3 inhibitor interest. Only 12% of Ultomiris-treated patients are identified as potential candidates for C3 switch.',
